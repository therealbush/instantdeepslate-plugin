# InstantDeepslate

#### An extremely simple plugin that allows you to instantly mine deepslate.

I used the [paperweight test plugin](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-test-plugin) as the base for this plugin, because I have no clue how to make paper plugins and couldn't find any other way to access the NMS code. 

This works by changing the blast resistance and break time values for deepslate blocks using reflection. They are all changed to their closest stone counterpart block. On it's own, this plugin will not make much of a difference, so I strongly reccomend using the [fabric](https://github.com/bush-did-711/instantdeepslate-fabric) or [forge](https://github.com/bush-did-711/instantdeepslate-forge) client mod that goes along with this. 

This plugin probably won't recieve any support, but it is so simple im sure anyone could figure out how to update it or add/remove blocks.
